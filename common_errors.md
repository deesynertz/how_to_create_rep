1: Error: failed to push some refs to <url.git>

```bash
git pull origin master --allow-unrelated-histories
```

2: The error fatal: pathspec '.env' did not match any files 
indicates that Git is not finding the .env file to remove it from the index (cache). This could happen for several reasons:

The file might not exist in the repository: Ensure that the .env file is actually tracked by Git. You can check if the file is being tracked by running git ls-files.

Incorrect path: Ensure that the .env file is in the correct directory and that there are no typos.

.gitignore file: If you have recently added .env to your .gitignore file and the file was not previously tracked by Git, it won't be tracked, and hence, Git won't find it.

Here are steps to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:

Step 1: Check if .env is tracked by Git
Run the following command to see if .env is tracked:

```sh
git ls-files | grep .env
```
If the .env file is not listed, it means Git is not tracking it.

Step 2: Ensure .env is in the correct directory
Make sure that the `.env` file is located in the root directory of your project or the correct directory where you expect it to be.

Step 3: Remove .env from Git tracking
If `.env` is tracked and you want to remove it from the repository but keep it in your local file system, follow these steps:

Check if the file is tracked:

```sh
git ls-files .env
```

Remove the file from the index (cache):
If the file is tracked, you can remove it from the index using:

```sh
git rm --cached .env
```

Add .env to .gitignore:
Ensure that .env is listed in your .gitignore file to prevent it from being tracked in the future.

```plainText
# .gitignore
.env
```

Commit the changes:
Commit the removal of `.env` from the index.

```sh
git commit -m "Remove .env from version control"
```

Step 4: Force-add .env to Git, then remove it (if necessary)
If `.env` was previously ignored but you need to remove it from the index, you can force-add it and then remove it:

Force-add .env to the index:

```sh
git add -f .env
```

Remove .env from the index:

```sh
git rm --cached .env
```

Commit the changes:

```sh
git commit -m "Remove .env from version control"
```

### Summary
. Verify the .env file is tracked by Git.</br>
. Ensure the correct path to .env.</br>
. Use git rm --cached .env to remove it from the index.</br>
. Add .env to .gitignore to prevent future tracking.</br>

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully remove the .env file from Git tracking.
