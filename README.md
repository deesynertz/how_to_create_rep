# how_to_create_rep
this will guide use on how to create, pull, clone, push on Github from/to  their local repository git

# Quick setup — if you’ve done this kind of thing before

Get started by ``creating a new file`` or ``uploading an existing file``. Github recommend every repository include a ``README, LICENSE, and .gitignore``.


## For those who created a new repository on the command line.

make sure you are in a folder  that will have working project on ``terminal for mac and linux`` and ``cmd or power-shell or gitbash`` then run the following command.


## steps

```powershell   

git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "any message you want to add as commit"
git branch -M master
git remote add origin <Your github rep URL> e.g https://github.com/deesynertz/how_to_create_rep.git
git push -u origin master

but you can use -f flag instead of -u during push activity

```


## push an existing repository from the command line

```bash
git remote add origin <Your github rep URL> e.g https://github.com/deesynertz/how_to_create_rep.git
git branch -M master
git push -u origin master 
```

Some basic Git commands are:
```
git status
git add
git commit "any message you want to add as commit"
git clone <Your github rep URL> e.g https://github.com/deesynertz/how_to_create_rep.git
git pull
```
